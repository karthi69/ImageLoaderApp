## App Architecure - MVVM + Clean Architecture
![Image Search Architecture](./images/Architecture.png "Class Structure")


I have implemented the app using MVVM + Clean Architecture 

The layers that form my architecture are:
- UI layer
- Domain layer
- Data layer


### UI layer

- I have used MVVM for UI layer.
- View model communicate to the usecase to get data.
- View controller fetch the data from model and present the view.
- UI layer has its own view entities different than domain entities.

### Domain layer

- Domain layer does not know anything about other layers, just fetches data from a repository defined as a protocol and returns the result.
- Domain layer has its own domain entities different than view o data entities.


### Data layer

- It uses Repository Pattern
- With repository pattern we can query our model objects from different data sources (Core Data, Realm, web server, etc.) with a only single-entry point. For now we have only  web server.
- Domain layer shouldnâ€™t know where the data comes from.
